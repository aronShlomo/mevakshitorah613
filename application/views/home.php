    <span>ABOUT THE SHUL</span>
    <p class="about-us">Nestled in the Valley of Greenspring, at the very active crossroads of Greenspring and Willow Glen avenues, is the new Congregation Mevakshei Torah. This warm, welcoming Shabbos minyan is located in the bais medrash attachment of the home of Rabbi and Mrs. B. Kestenbaum, who graciously opened their home to the new shul and its members. In the few short months since its inception, it has become a force in the neighborhood, with its own distinct personality, which has drawn interested individuals from many blocks around.</p>
