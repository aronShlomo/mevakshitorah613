    <span>ABOUT THE SHUL</span>
    <p class="about-us">A synagogue (שׁוּל) (shul) is a place of Jewish worship. In addition to housing a sanctuary for services, synagogues serve as the centerpoint of Jewish life. Known in Hebrew as beit knesset (בֵּית כְּנֶסֶת), “house of gathering,” the synagogue can be found virtually wherever there are Jews and has been in use since the Babylonian exile.</p>
