<p class="about-our-rabbi">OUR RABBI</p>

<p class="rabbi-about" >To describe what makes our little shul unique, we cannot overstate the obvious: It is our Rav. Raised in Bnei Brak, Rabbi Ori Millrod spent four years at Yeshivas Imrei Tzvi, where he was fortunate to be chavrusa to both the esteemed Rav Boruch Shmuel Deutsch and Rav Abba Berman. He also attended both Brisk and the Mir, and he provided shiurim for the young men at the Kollel Haran and also at the Yeshivat Ramat Shlomo in Yerushalayim, which he co-founded. He received semicha locally from Ner Yisrael in Baltimore.
    Most importantly, it is our Rav’s passion for spreading drashos and divrei Torah related to the parsha, machshava, and halacha that makes the shul such a magnet for people who thirst for this type of environment.
    Our Rav has been an active member of Rav Nachum Lansky’s shiur at Ner Yisrael for the past seven years, and he also continues to give shiurim in yeshivas, kollelim, and shuls throughout town. Additionally, he is an extensive writer, having composed several kuntrasim on mesechtos Baba Kamma and Yevamos, as well as a regular parsha sheet for the eager recipients.
    Rav Millrod’s family has long ties to our Baltimore community

        His grandmother was born in Baltimore and spent her childhood in the downtown Baltimore community. He followed in the footsteps of two of his uncles who studied at Yeshivas Ner Yisrael in the 1960s. In fact, he is related to the Blank family, which owned a fabric store here in town and were very big supporters of Ner Yisrael.
        Our shul’s format is an extension of the pattern established by Rav Hirsh Lefkowitz almost a decade ago. It is a heimishe minyan that includes tabletop davening, topical divrei Torah, and shared camaraderie. The Rav speaks after the conclusion of the davening on Friday night on the topic of machshava. During the post-davening kiddush, he speaks on an interesting aspect of halacha as motivated by the parsha. And he speaks again at the hosted shalosh seudos, which includes shteible-style nigunim and a variety of drashos and inspired conversations. (sponsorships are available!)
        Of course, all of the topics are connected to – or inspired by – a nuance in the parsha or the particular zman. Our davening is quite heimishe-style, and appeals to a variety of yeshiva tastes (sprinkled with some singing). Of late, we have been very fortunate, because the Rav’s brother Noam, also a student at Ner Yisrael, has been our excellent and accurate baal kri’ah. We are also fortunate to have a traditional halacha shiur, currently discussing detailed aspects of bishul on Shabbos, before Mincha on Shabbos afternoon.
        Our Rav’s passion is also manifest in his deep knowledge of Torah, which bursts forth like a wellspring. In a recent incident, a founding congregant, Mr. Joey Pollak, presented some intense and challenging questions to the Rav at the beginning of the kiddush. The questions were captivating on their own, and without any special preparation, the Rav was able to deliver 15 minutes of a comprehensive and detailed answer to Mr. Pollack’s question, referencing exact sources and quoting exact pages from those sources. It was phenomenal to behold this episode!
        I am drawn to Mevakshei Torah because of the Rav’s passion, his knowledge, the topics he discusses, and the unique format of the shul. Of course, it is Rabbi Millrod’s personality that ties all of these things together into one package that makes for an engaging and inspiring Shabbos experience.
        So many institutions are interested in physical growth as a primary objective. Our shul’s growth plan is different. Our shul is the place to come to daven and learn – to be welcomed into a small community that is interested in intellectual Torah growth, and profound questions are asked, discussed, analyzed, and answered. We welcome you to join us in our discussions and learn from our amazing Rav. Our minyan, guided by our powerful Rav, has a unique mission statement: “Gather here all ye who are intensely mevakshei Torah.”

        It’s just past 10:45am on Shabbos morning. Festive movement abounds—tables and chairs are reconfigured, joyful chatter emerges and the sumptuous aroma of cholent once faintly wafting now permeates the small room. Rabbi Ori Millrod rushes to grab a becher and lend a hand with set up. Moments from now he will launch into Kiddush Rabba with booming voice and distinct Israeli accent. Prepare to be transported to Yerushalayim.
        Rabbi Millrod’s weekly Shabbos shiur will begin, embarking from a nekuda in parasha and venturing forth into an animated and interactive quest through halacha and into the depths of machshava. Questions and challenges will erupt and be met with responses at reflex-like swiftness, referencing pesukim, Gemaras and a striking span of sifrei kodesh. I am wildly entertained, yet this is far more than entertainment.
        Rabbi Ori Moshe Millrod, the spirited pioneer of Kehillas Mevakshei Torah, grew up in Bnei Brak, Israel. His childhood neighbors included Rav Yaakov Galinksi zt’l, Rav Aharon Leib Shteinman zt’l, and Rav Chaim Kanievsky shlita—and he has a seemingly endless store of personal maasim involving these and other gedolei hador. As a teenager Rabbi Millrod relocated to Baltimore to learn in Yeshivas Ner Yisroel for close to a decade under the tutelage of Rabbi Nachum Lansky, shlita. It was there that he earned a doctorate in rabbanus? and received smicha in ….? With such a background, it is little wonder that that ambience of KMT is often feels like that of the Holy Land.
        Yet the shul offers more than mere atmosphere. Mevakshei Torah is a burgeoning hub of highly concentrated learning, a makom affording pathways to exponential growth. To follow Rabbi Millrod’s drashas require attunement to a process being modeled—one of honed curiosity, precise questioning, painstaking analysis, thorough and innovative resolutions. Don’t get distracted by the cholent.
        As the shiur concludes and the mispallelim depart for their seudahs, know that Shabbos at Mevakshei Torah has reached but one of many peaks. The lengthening summer afternoons offer a singular experience as the Rav’s father, a marital therapist for three decades throughout Israel, leads a vaad in shalom bayis expertly integrating divrei chazal with classic psychological theory while providing a warm forum for discussion and growth. Rabbi Millrod returns for an engaging halacha shiur followed by an intimate seudas shlishit of exploring contemporary and classic issues in halacha.
        Tucked away on the corner of Greenspring and Willow Glen, Mevakshei Torah is not your typical shul in Baltimore. If you aren’t looking, you may miss it. But should you happen upon us, you may find yourself wondering if you haven’t discovered a portal to somewhere much further east.
